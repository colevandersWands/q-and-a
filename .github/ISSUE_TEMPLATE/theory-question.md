## The Question
<!-- 
Be specific about what you want to understand:
- "When should I use a Map vs an Object in JavaScript?"
- "What's the difference between deep and shallow copying, and when does it matter?"
- "Why do we use dependency injection instead of importing modules directly?"
-->

## Context
<!-- 
What prompted this question:
- "Working on Module 5 state management - choosing data structures"
- "Debugging a weird bug where changing one object affects another"
- "Reading about testing patterns and seeing conflicting advice"
- "Refactoring my final project and questioning my architecture choices"
-->

## What I Think I Know
<!-- 
Your current understanding (misconceptions help others too):
- "Objects are faster for small datasets, Maps for large ones?"
- "I think shallow copy only copies the first level of properties"
- "Dependency injection makes testing easier but I'm not sure why"
- "I know there are differences but they seem to work the same in my code"
-->

## Specific Confusion
<!-- 
Where your understanding breaks down:
- "The syntax looks similar - when would I actually notice the difference?"
- "How 'deep' is deep? What counts as nested data?"
- "The examples I see are simple - how does this apply to real projects?"
- "Is this just academic or will I actually run into problems?"
-->

## Examples I've Seen
<!-- 
Reference points:
- "Week 3 notes mention it briefly but don't explain when to use which"
- "https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map"
- "Classmate's code uses Map for user data, mine uses Object - both work"
- "Our textbook chapter 7, but the examples are confusing"
