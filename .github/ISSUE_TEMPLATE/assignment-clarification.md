## Assignment Reference
<!-- 
Exact location and section:
- "Module 4, Exercise 2: 'Build a Weather App' - Step 3 requirements"
- "Final Project Specification, Section 2.1: Database Requirements"
- "Week 6 Lab: DOM Manipulation Challenge, Part B"
- "https://github.com/course/assignments/blob/main/week4/weather-app.md#step-3"
-->

## Specific Question
<!-- 
Exactly what needs clarification:
- "Does 'responsive design' mean mobile-first or just mobile-compatible?"
- "Should error handling cover network failures, invalid API keys, or both?"
- "When it says 'no external libraries' - does that include CSS frameworks?"
- "Are we supposed to implement our own sorting or can we use Array.sort()?"
-->

## My Interpretation
<!-- 
How you're reading the requirement:
- "I'm reading 'responsive' as 'works on mobile' but not necessarily mobile-first"
- "I think 'error handling' means try/catch around the fetch call"
- "I'm assuming Bootstrap is allowed since it's CSS, not JavaScript"
- "The wording suggests we should write our own sorting algorithm"
-->

## Impact on My Approach
<!-- 
How this affects your work:
- "Changes whether I start with mobile or desktop layout"
- "Determines if I need one error handler or multiple types"
- "Affects my CSS strategy - custom vs framework"
- "Could mean rewriting my entire sorting function vs using built-in methods"
-->

## What I've Checked
<!-- 
Your research so far:
- "Re-read assignment description and rubric - still unclear"
- "Checked Week 3 lecture where responsive design was introduced"
- "Looked at similar exercises from previous modules for precedent"
- "Asked two classmates - got different interpretations"
-->
