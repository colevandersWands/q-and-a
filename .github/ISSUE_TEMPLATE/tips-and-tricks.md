## The Tip
<!-- 
Concise description of the technique:
- "Use console.table() instead of console.log() for arrays and objects"
- "Keyboard shortcut: Cmd+D in VS Code to select next occurrence"
- "Add 'debugger;' statements instead of console.log for complex debugging"
- "Use CSS Grid's 'grid-template-areas' for readable responsive layouts"
-->

## When to Use It
<!-- 
Specific scenarios where this helps:
- "When debugging API responses with nested data"
- "When refactoring repetitive code across multiple files"
- "When your CSS layout breaks on mobile but works on desktop"
- "When you need to quickly test different values without reloading"
-->

## How It Works
<!-- 
Brief implementation or steps:
- "Replace console.log(data) with console.table(data) - shows objects in table format"
- "Select text, press Cmd+D repeatedly to select matching instances, edit all at once"
- "Browser pauses execution at 'debugger;' line, letting you inspect variables in real-time"
-->

## Problem It Solves
<!-- 
What pain point this addresses:
- "Stops you from scrolling through messy console output"
- "Saves time when renaming variables across files"
- "Eliminates guesswork about variable values during execution"
- "Makes responsive design logic clearer than media query comments"
