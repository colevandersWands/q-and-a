  - assign: anyone you would like help from
-->

## Code & Context
<!-- 
Include your code and error messages:
- a snippet in the MD of your issue or
- "https://github.com/yourname/project/blob/main/src/auth.js lines 45-67"
- "Gist: https://gist.github.com/yourname/abc123def456"
- Error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'then' of undefined at line 23"
- "Working on Module 4 fetch exercise, trying to display API data"
-->

## What I Want vs. What I Get
<!-- 
Be specific about the gap:
- Expected: "Login form should redirect to dashboard on successful authentication"
- Actual: "Form submits but stays on login page, no error message"
- Expected: "Array of objects from API call"
- Actual: "Promise pending object in console"
-->

## What I've Tried
<!-- 
Include failed attempts - they help others understand your thinking:
- "Added .then() but got 'undefined is not a function'"
- "Tried async/await syntax, same error"
- "Console.log shows data exists before the map function"
- "Googled 'fetch API returns undefined' - tried solutions from Stack Overflow"
- "Compared to working example in Week 3 notes - looks identical"
-->

## My Understanding
<!-- 
Show your mental model:
- "I think fetch returns a promise, and I need to wait for it to resolve"
- "The event listener should fire when I click submit, but it's not"
- "This should create a new array with modified objects, but I get undefined"
- "I'm confused about why 'this' refers to the window instead of my object"
-->

## Relevant Resources
<!-- 
What you've referenced:
- "MDN fetch documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"
- "Week 4 lecture notes on promises"
- "Similar working example from our in-class demo (but different data structure)"
