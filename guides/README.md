## You are in Control

Throughout your Amana journey and your overall career as a programmer, you will
be responsible for your own learning. 25-30 hours of study per week is just the minimum
we suggest. The more time you spend and the better you study, the faster you
will find yourself in a job you love. The more you participate and become part
of the web development community, the more friends you will make, and the more
people will want to help you.

This is not a race against the curriculum or a race against other students. It's
a marathon to a new career, and no one is giving you a rank.

## Collaboration vs. Cheating

Collaborating is encouraged, cheating is not tolerated. There is a large
difference between stealing and collaboration, even if the end result looks the
same (you and another student have the same code). If we find two or more
homework assignments with the same code we will check in with everyone involved
to see if this was collaborative work or cheating:

- **Collaboration** is when you ask each other for help or for explanations, you
  voluntarily share code, and take the time to explain/understand what has been
  shared.
- **Cheating** is when you copy someone‚Äôs code to complete the homeworks without
  taking to the time to understand it, without letting them know, or without
  them explaining why they wrote what they did.

You will not be getting grades on every exercise, so if you cheat you're only
cheating yourself!
